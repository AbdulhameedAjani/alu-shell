# ALU Shell

In this repo, you will find different programs written on System Engineering & devops for the ALU BSE program. While working on these projects, I was able to learn scripting with bash efficiently and also how to navigate through the terminal. Below are the projects I have worked on:

* [0x00-shell_basics](0x00-shell_basics)
* [0x01-shell_permissions](0x01-shell_permissions)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x02-shell_redirections](0x02-shell_redirections)
* [0x03-shell_variables_expansions](0x03-shell_variables_expansions)

- I am commited to continuosly updating this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed above.
